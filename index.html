                The players who broke away were taking a significant gamble –
                the tournament was broadcast on satellite television rather than
                terrestrial, and from 1994 to 2001, the prize fund for the
                players in the WDC/PDC World Championship was lower than the
                prize fund in the (BDO version, although the 1997 PDC World
                Champion received £45,000 compared to that year's BDO World
                Champion receiving £38,000. In 2002, the PDC prize fund overtook
                that of the BDO for the first time, and the PDC event now boasts
                the largest prize fund of any darts competition. In 2010, the
                prize fund reached £1 million for the first time, with the
                champion collecting £200,000.

                The 2014 and 2015 PDC world champions collected £250,000 for
                their wins. For the next three years, the winner's share
                increased by £50,000 each year culminating in a 2018 prize fund
                of £1.8 million.[1] The prize fund for the tournament was £2.5
                million with £500,000 to the winner from 2019. The 2025/26 World
                Championship will see the field expand to 128 players with the
                prize fund increasing to £5 million with a record £1 million to
                the champion. The tournament has been held at Alexandra Palace
                in London since 2008, having previously been held at the Circus
                Tavern in Purfleet, Essex, from 1994 to 2007.[2] Currently, the
                play takes place inside the venue's West Hall, which has a
                capacity of 3,200.[3

                The PDC championship began in 1994 as the WDC World Darts
                Championship as one of the consequences of the split in darts,
                which saw the World Darts Council break away from the BDO. As a
                result of the settlement between the BDO and the WDC in 1997,
                the WDC became the PDC, and players were then free to choose
                which world championship to enter (but not both in the same
                year), as long as they met certain eligibility criteria. Both
                organisations continued to organize their own world championship
                until the 2020 editions, after which the BDO folded
