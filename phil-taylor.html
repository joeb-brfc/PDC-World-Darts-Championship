              <h1>Phil Taylor: Early Life and Rise in Darts</h1>

              <p>
                <strong>Phil Taylor</strong> was born on 13 August 1960 in
                Stoke-on-Trent, the only child of Douglas and Elizabeth Taylor.
                He grew up in poverty, living in a condemned terraced house
                without electricity or running water. As a child, he often
                scavenged for scrap metal and coal with his parents. He enjoyed
                watching boxing and played cricket at Mill Hill Middle School.
              </p>

              <p>
                After leaving school at 16, Taylor worked various manual jobs,
                including as a sheet metal worker. His main occupation became
                making ceramic toilet roll holders, earning £52 a week.
              </p>

              <p>
                At 17, Taylor met his future wife, Yvonne, at a disco. They
                moved in together in 1982, had their first child in 1983, and
                married in 1988. They had four children together. Taylor
                occasionally played darts in pubs, using winnings to buy
                essentials for their home.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 1985, Taylor and Yvonne attended an exhibition by world
                champion <strong>Eric Bristow</strong>. Inspired and supported
                by Yvonne, who gifted him darts for his 25th birthday, Taylor
                began practicing regularly at Bristow's pub, the Crafty Cockney.
                Within two years, he was playing county darts for Staffordshire.
                Bristow saw potential in Taylor and loaned him £10,000 to
                support his family, on the condition he quit his job and pursue
                darts professionally.

              <h1>Phil Taylor: Career Highlights (1994–2004)</h1>

              <h2>1994 to 1998</h2>
              <p>
                After losing the first PDC World Championship final to Dennis
                Priestley in 1994, <strong>Phil Taylor</strong> began a period
                of dominance. He won the 1995 final against Rod Harrington 6–2,
                marking Harrington’s only appearance in a World Championship
                final.
              </p>

              <p>
                From 1996 to 1998, Taylor faced Priestley in three consecutive
                finals. Despite Priestley hitting a record 100+ average in the
                1996 final, Taylor won 6–4. In 1997, Taylor recovered from a 0–2
                deficit to win 6–3. His 1998 win was especially dominant, losing
                just two legs and averaging 103.98 in a 6–0 victory. With this
                sixth title, Taylor surpassed his mentor Eric Bristow’s five
                World Championships.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the World Matchplay event at Blackpool, Taylor had a more
                mixed early record, losing in 1994, 1996, and 1998. However, he
                secured wins in 1995 against Priestley and in 1997 against Alan
                Warriner-Little, both by a 16–11 margin.
              </p>

              <h2>1999 to 2004</h2>
              <p>
                Taylor extended his unbeaten streak in the PDC World
                Championship to eight years. He won titles against Peter Manley
                in 1999 and 2002, Dennis Priestley in 2000, and John Part in
                2001. This run ended in 2003 when Part defeated him 7–6 in a
                closely fought final. Some attributed the loss to Taylor’s
                weight loss, which may have affected his balance and accuracy.
              </p>

              <p>
                During this period, Taylor became dominant in the World
                Matchplay, winning five consecutive titles from 2000 to 2004.
                His final opponents during that stretch were Alan
                Warriner-Little (2000), Richie Burnett (2001), John Part (2002),
                Wayne Mardle (2003), and Mark Dudbridge (2004).
              </p>

              <p>
                By the end of 2004, Taylor had amassed
                <strong>11 PDC World Championship titles</strong> and
                <strong>7 World Matchplay titles</strong>, cementing his legacy
                as the sport's most successful player.

              <h1>Phil Taylor: Career Highlights (2004–2011)</h1>

              <h2>2004–2006: Return to the Top</h2>
              <p>
                In 2004, Phil Taylor reclaimed the PDC World Championship by
                narrowly defeating Kevin Painter 7–6 in a sudden-death leg.
                Despite trailing during the match, Taylor admitted he had been
                outplayed and called it one of the best finals he'd experienced.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2005 and early 2006, Taylor continued to dominate the sport,
                winning his 13th World Championship in January 2006. However,
                that year also saw uncharacteristic early exits in several
                tournaments, including defeats to Jelle Klaasen, Simon Whitlock,
                and Raymond van Barneveld. Taylor rebounded by winning the World
                Matchplay, World Darts Trophy, and the World Grand Prix later
                that year.
              </p>

              <h2>2007–2008: A Challenging Period</h2>
              <p>
                The 2007 World Final between Taylor and van Barneveld went to a
                deciding leg, with van Barneveld claiming victory. Taylor
                described it as possibly the best final he had played in.
              </p>
              <p>
                That year, Taylor endured a rare title drought. He was
                eliminated early in major tournaments and faced criticism from
                fellow player Chris Mason, who was later fined and suspended for
                his conduct. Taylor’s 13-year streak of reaching the PDC World
                Championship final ended in 2008 when he lost a dramatic
                quarter-final to Wayne Mardle after leading 3–0 in sets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Taylor introduced a new set of black 26g darts and made a strong
                comeback in the Premier League Darts. Despite a poor start, he
                topped the table and went on to win the title, posting
                exceptional averages. He also secured wins at the US Open, Las
                Vegas Desert Classic, World Matchplay, World Grand Prix,
                European Championship, and Grand Slam of Darts during 2008.
              </p>

              <h2>2009–2011: Records and Resurgence</h2>
              <p>
                In 2009, Taylor won his 14th World Championship title by beating
                van Barneveld 7–1 with a record-breaking average of 110.94 in
                the final. He also won the UK Open, Las Vegas Desert Classic,
                World Matchplay, World Grand Prix, European Championship, and
                Grand Slam of Darts, completing a dominant year.
              </p>
              <p>
                Taylor began 2010 by winning his 15th World Championship,
                defeating Simon Whitlock in the final. Later that year, he made
                history by hitting <strong>two nine-dart finishes</strong> in a
                single televised match during the Premier League final against
                James Wade. Taylor held all but one of the major PDC titles and
                set a new world record average of <strong>118.66</strong> in a
                match against Kevin Painter at the UK Open.
              </p>
              <p>
                He was nominated for
                <strong>BBC Sports Personality of the Year</strong>, finishing
                second behind A.P. McCoy.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2011, Taylor experienced some key defeats but bounced back to
                win the Players Championship Finals and his
                <strong>12th World Matchplay title</strong>, defeating James
                Wade in the final. He also won his
                <strong>fourth consecutive European Championship</strong> and
                swept the <strong>Championship League</strong>, winning all
                three group stages and the final.
              </p>
              <p>
                Taylor capped the year with a win at the
                <strong>Grand Slam of Darts</strong>, beating Gary Anderson in
                the final. However, he fell short in defending the Players
                Championship, losing to Mervyn King in the last 16.

              <h1>Phil Taylor: Career Highlights (2012–2015)</h1>

              <h2>2012</h2>
              <p>
                In 2012, Taylor failed to make the quarter-finals of the PDC
                World Championship for the first time in his career following a
                shock four sets to one defeat in the second round by Dave
                Chisnall.
              </p>

              <p>
                Taylor, looking to improve upon England's second round exit in
                2010, represented England alongside Adrian Lewis in his second
                World Cup of Darts. Taylor began the tournament sluggishly,
                losing his singles matches against Ken MacNeil of Canada and
                Gary Mawson of the United States. England progressed following a
                sudden-death leg against Canada and a doubles victory against
                the United States. A comfortable 5–1 win over Wales booked
                England's place in the final against the Australian pairing of
                Simon Whitlock and Paul Nicholson. Taylor won both his singles
                matches (including a 105.93 average against Whitlock). However,
                England lost the doubles meaning that the tie was level on
                points at 3–3 and consequently, would require a sudden-death
                leg. It proved to be a tense finale as Australia missed four
                darts to win the title. Taylor also missed two before Lewis took
                out double five to clinch England's first World Cup of Darts
                title.
              </p>

              <p>
                Four days later, Taylor played Lewis in the first week of the
                2012 Premier League and managed to draw 7–7 from a 6–1 deficit.
                He averaged 112.79, which was until 2015 the highest average
                achieved by someone without actually winning the match. Taylor
                hit the ninth televised nine-darter of his career in the second
                week of the Premier League on the way to an 8–5 win against
                Kevin Painter. Two weeks later, he beat Simon Whitlock 8–4 and
                registered the highest three-dart average in the history of the
                tournament of 117.35. In week 13, Taylor beat James Wade 8–1 and
                averaged 116.10 in the process. Taylor ended the league campaign
                top of the table (eight points ahead of second placed Simon
                Whitlock) and was the only player to have a positive leg
                difference. In the 14 game league phase, Taylor had registered
                five of the top fifteen televised three-dart averages in the
                history of the game.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the semi-finals, he faced James Wade against whom he had
                inflicted heavy 8–1 and 8–2 defeats during the league stage. The
                semi-final, however, was much more competitive. Taylor trailed
                early on before winning four consecutive legs to lead 6–4 before
                Wade responded to level at 6–6. Taylor then took out a 149
                finish, with Wade on 57, to break before closing out the match
                8–6 to reach the final against Simon Whitlock. Taylor looked to
                be heading for a comfortable win in the final as he raced into a
                7–2 lead. However, the Australian stormed back to level at 7–7.
                Nevertheless, Taylor held his nerve to win the last three legs
                of the match to complete a 10–7 win and to seal his sixth
                Premier League title.
              </p>

              <p>
                Taylor won the third event of the Players Championship in March
                with a 6–1 victory over Wes Newton while averaging 113.54. He
                also hit a nine-darter earlier in the tournament during his
                second round match against Tony West. He reached the final of
                the fourth Players Championship event a day later where he lost
                6–5 to Dave Chisnall. Taylor hit his second nine-dart finish of
                the weekend in a first round match against Peter Hudson.
              </p>

              <p>
                In June, Taylor looked on course to win his fifth UK Open title
                after registering convincing wins over Ronnie Baxter, Terry
                Jenkins and Denis Ovens to book a place in the final against
                Robert Thornton. Taylor won the first two legs, but the Scot
                then won nine of the next 10 before closing out the match 11–5.
                Taylor had missed a total of 23 darts at doubles and, in doing
                so, suffered his sixth defeat in a major PDC final out of the 72
                he had contested. Taylor then played in his first European Tour
                event and gained revenge for his defeat in the World
                Championship by beating Chisnall 6–2 in the final. He had beaten
                Raymond van Barneveld 6–5 in the quarter-finals and Wes Newton
                6–3 in the semis at the event in Berlin.
              </p>

              <p>
                In July, Taylor walked off the stage at the Shetland Open during
                a semi-final match with Raymond van Barneveld.
              </p>

              <p>
                Taylor then won his fifth consecutive World Matchplay title and
                thirteenth in total. He beat Mervyn King 10–8, Ian White 13–3,
                Andy Hamilton 16–11 and Ronnie Baxter 17–10 to face James Wade
                in the final for the fourth time. The final proved to be tight
                and tense, with Taylor edging it 18–15 and extending his
                unbeaten run at the event to 25 games.
              </p>

              <p>
                In September, Taylor suffered defeat in the European
                Championship for the first time in a 10–6 quarter-final loss to
                Brendan Dolan. He averaged just 89.88 in a defeat which ended
                his run of four consecutive titles stretching back to the
                inaugural tournament in 2008. Taylor then lost to Thornton in a
                major event for the second time this year as he missed six match
                darts on the way to a three sets to two defeat in the second
                round of the World Grand Prix.
              </p>

              <p>
                Taylor qualified from Group 4 of the Championship League winning
                all nine of his games and concluding with a 6–1 win over Mark
                Walsh. In the winners' group, he won each of his seven league
                matches before defeating Dave Chisnall 6–0 in the semi-finals
                (averaging 112.73) and Simon Whitlock 6–4 in the final
                (averaging 108.20) to clinch his third Championship League
                title.
              </p>

              <p>
                Taylor finished second in Group A of the Grand Slam of Darts to
                face Michael van Gerwen in the last 16. It was a match that was
                billed as a clash between the two best players in the world.
                Taylor averaged 105 but failed to hit a single maximum as van
                Gerwen hit seven and averaged 108 in a 10–5 win.
              </p>

              <p>
                Taylor lost in consecutive Players Championship finals over the
                last weekend of November to both Chisnall and Van Gerwen,
                averaging 110 in the latter. He finished sixth on the ProTour
                Order of Merit to qualify for the Finals where he won his third
                title. Taylor defeated Mark Webster and Adrian Lewis in the
                first two rounds, but was then 9–5 down in the quarter-finals to
                Andy Hamilton in a best of 19 legs match. However, Taylor
                allowed Hamilton only one chance to win the match when on a 60
                finish. Hamilton missed the board with his first dart and failed
                to hit double 20 with his third as Taylor won the five
                consecutive legs he required to win 10–9. He outplayed Simon
                Whitlock in the semi-finals in an 11–2 victory and, with the
                scores at 5–5 in the final against Kim Huybrechts, Taylor
                produced a devastating run of form to win eight of the following
                nine legs to secure the title.
              </p>

              <h2>2013</h2>
              <p>
                Taylor won his 16th World Championship at the 2013 staging of
                the event. He lost nine legs on the way to the semi-finals where
                he played Raymond van Barneveld. Before the match, Taylor had
                taken offence to comments made by van Barneveld about not being
                scared of him and wanting to face him rather than Taylor's
                quarter-final opponent Andy Hamilton. Taylor raced into a five
                sets to one lead and withstood a strong fightback from van
                Barneveld before winning 6–4. After the match, Taylor reacted
                angrily when van Barneveld attempted to pull him back to
                congratulate him after their handshake. The pair were escorted
                from the stage separately by security staff. The next day,
                Taylor apologised for his behaviour which he described as
                "disgraceful." Taylor faced Michael van Gerwen in the final and,
                from 4–2 down, won five sets in a row to become the first man to
                lift the Sid Waddell Trophy. A day later, he was named the PDC
                Player of the Year.
              </p>

              <p>
                Taylor retained his World Cup of Darts crown alongside Adrian
                Lewis in February. They survived two match darts against South
                Africa in the last 16 and one against Wales in the semi-finals
                before facing the Belgian brothers Ronny and Kim Huybrechts in
                the final. Taylor beat Ronny 4–0 and went into his second
                singles match knowing that a win against Kim would secure the
                title. He did just that by virtue of a 4–1 win.
              </p>

              <p>
                Taylor did not finish top of the Premier League for the first
                time this year. He won eight, drew four and lost four of his 16
                matches to finish third in the table. He played Van Barneveld in
                the semi-finals who he had beaten 7–3 and drawn with 6–6 during
                the league stage. From 3–3, Taylor surged ahead to triumph 8–4
                and book his spot in the final against Van Gerwen. Taylor
                started the better of the two as he led 5–3 at the break.
                However, he then lost four successive legs upon the resumption
                of play. In the 14th leg, Van Gerwen opted not to go for the
                bull when on 87 and Taylor stepped in to hit a 160 finish to
                level the match at 7–7. At 9–8 down, Taylor had left 40 after 12
                darts. Nonetheless, Van Gerwen hit a 132 finish on the bull to
                seal a 10–8 win and the title.
              </p>

              <p>
                Taylor won his fifth UK Open title at his next event. He had to
                compete in the second round due to being ranked 44th on the UK
                Open Order of Merit after competing in four of the eight
                Qualifiers and not advancing beyond the quarter-finals in any of
                them. At the tournament, he dropped three legs in his first
                three matches before getting lucky in the last 16 against
                Brendan Dolan. Dolan missed three match darts to win 9–7 before
                Taylor threw an 11 dart leg in the decider. He produced an
                average of 106.56 to beat Van Gerwen 10–7 before easing past
                Peter Wright 10–5 in the semi-finals and Andy Hamilton 11–4 in
                the final. Taylor's combined average during the six matches he
                played was more than 100.
              </p>

              <p>
                Taylor then won the Gibraltar Darts Trophy. He dropped just
                seven legs in the six matches he played which concluded with a
                6–1 victory over Jamie Lewis in the final. However, Taylor's win
                in Gibraltar was later the subject of controversy as footage
                emerged showing him winning a leg and retrieving his dart when
                he had actually missed the double. Neither referee Russ Bray nor
                his opponent Dean Winstanley noticed the error and Taylor went
                on to win the match 6–1. Taylor insisted that he had not
                realised that the dart had missed and offered to replay the
                match and forfeit his prize money. The PDC released a statement
                blaming the incident on human error. The incident led to a feud
                with Taylor's old mentor Eric Bristow who stated: "The player
                knows if it's not in the bed and has to declare it. You don't
                want cheats in the game". Taylor responded by claiming that
                Bristow's comments were "hurtful" and that he would not be
                talking to Bristow again.

              <h1>Phil Taylor: Career Highlights (2012–2015)</h1>

              <h2>2015</h2>
              <p>
                Taylor reached the semi-finals of the 2015 World Championship,
                but lost in a dramatic 7–6 final against Gary Anderson. Despite
                a valiant comeback, he missed crucial doubles and couldn't
                secure a victory. Taylor won the last UK Open Qualifier but was
                eliminated in the quarter-finals of the UK Open. He struggled in
                the Premier League and missed the playoffs for the first time in
                its history. However, he won his second title of the year at the
                Players Championship, defeating Anderson 6–4. Taylor and Adrian
                Lewis secured England's third World Cup title, with Taylor
                setting the highest individual average in the tournament's
                history.
              </p>

              <p>
                He also retained his Perth Darts Masters title and triumphed at
                the Sydney Darts Masters. His 38-match unbeaten streak at the
                World Matchplay ended in the semi-finals, and he was eliminated
                early in the World Grand Prix. In the Grand Slam, Taylor was
                ahead but ultimately lost 16–13 to Michael van Gerwen in a match
                where missed doubles cost him dearly.
              </p>

              <h2>2016</h2>
              <p>
                Taylor's 2016 World Championship run ended in a third-round loss
                to Jelle Klaasen, while he struggled with missed match darts in
                the semi-finals of the Masters. He broke his ranking title
                drought with a win at the third UK Open Qualifier and reached
                the semi-finals of the UK Open, but was defeated by van Gerwen.
                Taylor made his eighth Premier League final but was beaten 11–3
                by van Gerwen.
              </p>

              <p>
                He won his fourth World Cup title with Lewis and claimed victory
                at the Austrian Darts Open. Taylor triumphed in the Sydney Darts
                Masters again and secured victory in the inaugural Champions
                League of Darts. However, he faced early defeats in the World
                Grand Prix and European Championship.
              </p>

              <h2>2017</h2>
              <p>
                Taylor made his 28th consecutive appearance at the World
                Championship but was defeated by Raymond van Barneveld in the
                quarter-finals. Taylor confirmed his retirement plans,
                announcing he would retire after the 2018 World Championship. He
                had a strong showing in the Premier League but was narrowly
                defeated in the semi-finals by Peter Wright. Taylor's final
                World Matchplay victory was his 16th title at the event, marking
                his last major win.
              </p>

              <p>
                In August 2017, Taylor won the Melbourne Darts Masters, his
                final World Series title, and reached the final of his last
                event in the series, losing to Peter Wright.
              </p>

              <h2>2018</h2>
              <p>
                The 2018 PDC World Darts Championship was Taylor's 29th and
                final appearance at the event. He reached the final, but was
                defeated 7–2 by Rob Cross. Despite missing a chance for a
                nine-dart finish in the final, Taylor praised Cross's
                performance and officially confirmed his retirement after the
                tournament. Taylor reflected on his career, noting that he no
                longer had the energy or interest to compete at the top level.
