              Phil Taylor Early life, meeting wife and future mentor Eric
              Bristow
            </h5>
            <p>
              Phil Taylor was born on 13 August 1960 in Stoke-on-Trent, the only
              child of Douglas and Elizabeth Taylor. He grew up in poverty,
              living in a condemned terraced house without electricity or
              running water. As a child, he often scavenged for scrap metal and
              coal with his parents. He enjoyed watching boxing and played
              cricket at Mill Hill Middle School.
            </p>
            <p>
              After leaving school at 16, Taylor worked various manual jobs,
              including as a sheet metal worker. His main occupation became
              making ceramic toilet roll holders, earning Â£52 a week. At 17,
              Taylor met his future wife, Yvonne, at a disco. They moved in
              together in 1982, had their first child in 1983, and married in
              1988. They had four children together. Taylor occasionally played
              darts in pubs, using winnings to buy essentials for their home.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1985, Taylor and Yvonne attended an exhibition by world
              champion Eric Bristow. Inspired and supported by Yvonne, who
              gifted him darts for his 25th birthday, Taylor began practicing
              regularly at Bristow's pub, the Crafty Cockney. Within two years,
              he was playing county darts for Staffordshire. Bristow saw
              potential in Taylor and loaned him Â£10,000 to support his family,
              on the condition he quit his job and pursue darts professionally.
